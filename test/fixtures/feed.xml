Today we are pleased to announce that we are adding Windows 10 Desktop licenses to the BYOL program, allowing you to use the Windows 10 Desktop operating system on your Amazon WorkSpaces running on hardware that is dedicated to you. Just like when you bring your own Windows 7 Desktop licenses, this option entitles you to a discount of $4 per month per WorkSpace, and also allows you to use a single Windows 10 Desktop golden image on-premises and for your Amazon WorkSpaces.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this option, your organization must meet the licensing requirements set by Microsoft, and you must commit to running at least 200 WorkSpaces in a given AWS region each month.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this option and the eligibility requirements, please see the &lt;a href="/workspaces/faqs/#BYOL"&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 23:51:52 +0000</pubDate><category>general:products/amazon-workspaces</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/07/amazon-ec2-container-service-automatic-service-scaling-region-expansion/</link><guid>aefcd30c9e641e3cd20ead7b3a4f4a02aa09fead</guid><title>Amazon EC2 Container Service Automatic Service Scaling Region Expansion</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) automatic service scaling is now available in five additional regions: US West (N.
